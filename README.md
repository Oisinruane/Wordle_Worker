# Wordle Worker

Plays Wordle for me so I can focus on more important things in life, like figuring out how to automate Connections.

This script automates playing the popular game Wordle by using Selenium to interact with the New York Times Wordle webpage. It uses a **word-scoring system** and **deductive reasoning** to find the correct five-letter word in as few guesses as possible.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Dependencies and Libraries

**Python:** Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
**Selenium:** Used in Play_script.py to automate browser interactions, specifically for navigating to the Wordle website and making guesses.
**A WebDriver:** The script needs a WebDriver to control your browser.
**flask:** Used in WebServer.py to create a simple web server for the results dashboard.
**schedule:** Used in main.py to schedule the run_game() function to play the Wordle game at a specific time each day.
**csv:** A built-in Python library used in both Play_script.py and WebServer.py for reading from and writing to the results.csv and word_scores.csv files.
**threading:** A built-in Python library used in main.py to run the web server and the scheduler concurrently.

### Support Files

**results.csv:** This file is created by the Play_script.py file to store the history and outcome of each Wordle game played.
**word_scores.csv:** This is a crucial data file used by Play_script.py. It contains a list of five-letter words along with their calculated scores, which the bot uses to make strategic guesses.
**index.html:** HTML for the results webpage

## üß© Game Play Script

The bot follows a systematic approach to solving the Wordle puzzle:

  - **Initial Guess:** It always starts with the word **"crane"** as its first guess. This is a common strategy in Wordle as it contains highly frequent letters.
  - **Analyzing Results:** After each guess, the bot analyzes the color-coded tiles (`correct`, `present`, or `absent`) to update its knowledge of the puzzle.
  - **Filtering Words:** Based on the results, it **filters its internal word list**, removing any words that don't match the new information (e.g., words with absent letters or words where a "present" letter is in the wrong spot).
  - **Choosing the Next Guess:** From the remaining possible words, it selects the word with the **highest score** from the `word_scores.csv` file. This scoring system helps it choose words that are more likely to contain the correct letters.
  - **Logging:** The bot logs each game's guesses and results to a `results.csv` file, providing a record of its performance.

## üñ•Ô∏è Web App

The Wordle Worker webpage, generated by the WebServer.py script and the index.html file, serves as a simple dashboard to display the results of the automated Wordle game. It uses data from the results.csv file to present the following information:

  - **Today's Game:** Highlights the most recent game played, showing the guesses made by the bot and the outcome of each guess.
  - **Game History:** Provides a breakdown of all previous games, including whether they were solved or not and the final solution.
  - **Guess Distribution Chart:** Displays a statistical overview of the bot's performance by showing how many games were solved in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 guesses, or failed entirely.

This web page provides a clean and easy-to-read interface for tracking the project's performance over time.

## üìù Word Score System

The word_scores.csv file is crucial for the Wordle bot's strategic decision-making. The list is populated with five-letter words, each assigned a numerical score based on the frequency of its letters within the entire Wordle dataset. Words containing more common letters, such as 'E', 'A', 'R', 'O', and 'S', are given higher scores because they are more likely to contain letters present in the solution. This method ensures the bot's initial and subsequent guesses are as efficient as possible, maximizing the chances of revealing correct and present letters early in the game to narrow down the pool of possible words.
